<h2>AddTillWeekday</h2>
<br/>
This program will advance the given datetime to the weekday you choose<br/>
For example, if you have a datetime on a monday and choose Friday, it will advance the datetime 5 days.<br/>
Advancing to the same weekday the datetime has will advance a full week (if you choose monday the system will pick the next monday)

The "beginning of day" flag will keep the given datetime time if false or reset the datetime to 00:00:00 if true
